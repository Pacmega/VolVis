# VolVis
Volvis data visualization project in JAVA, can load standard volumetric data (.fld). 
Implementing,some 2D visualizations (MPR (multiplanar reformation (slices) with NN, linear and Tricubic interpolation),
for Direct Volume Rendering - Raycasting with Maximum Intensity Projection and Colour compositing (with phong shading aswell as toon shading), 
and for Indirect Volume Rendering - Isosurfaces (with shading aswell)
This also contains 1 and 2D transfer functions to parametrize rendering, when applicable.
